# Building a Multi-Method Search Page

Building a search page that incorporates different search methodologies and technologies can provide users with a robust and versatile experience. Below is a structured outline for the search page, including explanations of each method, its pros and cons, and a mockup for the implementation in a web application. Each method will utilize a Docker image for deployment.

## Search Page Outline

**Title:** Multi-Method Search Page

### Search Box
- An input field for users to type their search queries.

## Search Methodologies

### Type 1: BM25
- **Explanation:**
  - BM25 (Best Matching 25) is a probabilistic retrieval model that ranks documents based on the query's terms. It considers term frequency (how often a term appears in a document), inverse document frequency (how rare a term is across documents), and document length normalization.
  
- **Pros:**
  - **Simplicity:** Easy to implement and understand.
  - **Effectiveness:** Performs well for keyword-based searches.
  - **No need for extensive preprocessing.**
  
- **Cons:**
  - **Lacks understanding of synonyms and semantics.**
  - **Performance can degrade on long documents.**
  
- **Docker Image:** `docker pull bm25_image:latest`
- **Display Results:** List results ranked by BM25 score.

### Type 2: Reverse Index with Elasticsearch
- **Explanation:**
  - Elasticsearch uses an inverted index, which is a data structure that maps terms to their locations in documents. When a document is indexed, the text is tokenized, and terms are stored in the index with references to the document IDs where they appear.
  
- **Pros:**
  - **Fast search capabilities:** Quick retrieval of documents based on queries.
  - **Scalability:** Handles large datasets efficiently.
  - **Supports complex queries (e.g., filters, aggregations).**
  
- **Cons:**
  - **Requires setup and maintenance of an Elasticsearch cluster.**
  - **Overhead in managing the index.**
  
- **Docker Image:** `docker pull elasticsearch_image:latest`
- **Display Results:** List results ranked by Elasticsearch scores.

### Type 3: Semantic Embedding Using Title and Description
- **Explanation:**
  - This method involves generating semantic embeddings for product titles and descriptions using a pre-trained CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model. The embeddings are stored in a vector database like Qdrant for efficient similarity searches.
  
- **Pros:**
  - **Captures semantic meaning,** improving relevance in search results.
  - **Handles synonyms and related concepts** better than keyword-based methods.
  
- **Cons:**
  - **Computationally intensive for generating embeddings.**
  - **Requires vector storage and management.**
  
- **Docker Image:** `docker pull qdrant_image:latest`
- **Display Results:** List results based on semantic similarity scores.

### Type 4: Semantic and Image Embedding
- **Explanation:**
  - Similar to Type 3, but this method also includes image embeddings from the same CLIP model. Both text and image embeddings are stored in Qdrant, allowing for searches based on either modality.
  
- **Pros:**
  - **Enhances search capabilities** by incorporating image context.
  - **Useful for visual search scenarios** where images are key.
  
- **Cons:**
  - **Increased complexity in managing text and image embeddings.**
  - **More resource-intensive.**
  
- **Docker Image:** `docker pull qdrant_image:latest`
- **Display Results:** List results based on combined similarity scores.

### Type 5: Combined Approaches with Reranking Model
- **Explanation:**
  - This approach integrates results from Type 1 (BM25), Type 2 (Elasticsearch), Type 3 (semantic embedding), and Type 4 (semantic and image embedding). A reranking model (e.g., a machine learning model) is used to refine the results based on relevance and user feedback.
  
- **Pros:**
  - **Combines the strengths of all methods** for improved result quality.
  - **Adaptable to user preferences and context.**
  
- **Cons:**
  - **Complexity in implementation and maintenance.**
  - **Requires data for training the reranking model.**
  
- **Docker Image:** `docker pull reranking_model_image:latest`
- **Display Results:** Final ranked list after reranking.
